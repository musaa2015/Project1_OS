/*

File os_syscalls.c

Standalone C system call wrappers for linux/i386.

The code here uses assembly to perform the actual syscalls,
and provides user programs with C wrapper functions such
as os_exit(), os_write(), etc, which have a far more portable
format (like the C library wrappers for system calls).
